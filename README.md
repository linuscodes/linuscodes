## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Linus, a self-taught and constantly learning front-end developer and UI/UX designer from Hamburg. 

I am currently working on [Meet](https://themeetapp.de), which is an approach for easier planning to meet your friends, together with [Kevin](https://github.com/schaefkn). We're planning to launch the first beta in the middle of July 2020.

Also, I work with the folks at [Major Keys](https://majorkeys.de) to build up the idea of online piano lessons where you can learn at your own speed an always have a coach available to help you with any struggles. I love it!

### Personal

Since February 2020, I am self-employed and found my first _company_. Doing this with 15 years was not easy, but I managed to get everything up and running. Check more on [linuscodes.com](https://linuscodes.com)

Feel free to follow my journey on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/linuscodes) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/linuscodes). Sometimes, I write down some thoughts and publish them to my [Blog](https://blog.linuscodes.com) as well.

**Have a great day! ðŸ¤©**
